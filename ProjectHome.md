**Update:** I do not own an NDAS device anymore. If you would like to take over development of KaNDAS, send me a patch to proof that you know your way around the code, and I'll grant you developer rights.

The KaNDAS suite consists of the KaNDASd daemon, the KaNDAS user interface for the KDE 4 desktop, and the KaNDASconsole toolkit. The current release for all components is version 0.2.0.

Source tarballs are available from the Downloads tab. Users of openSUSE 10.3 and later can use the following link:
